                    Rachel and Logan initially "met" in passing during marching band in college
                    their freshman year. They stuck to their own crowds for about three years until
                    they finally crossed paths. On their way to a band show (5 hours away) Logan
                    began walking up the isle of their bus polling all of the people (1 ply or 2
                    ply). Rachel was reading a book and did not want to be disturbed. She was
                    annoyed by his disruption to her book (it was a very good book in her defense).
                    Eventually, after she finished her book, she started to realize that the polling
                    was, in fact, funny.

                    <br />
                    Much later, Rachel and Logan began texting back and forth. They eventually went
                    on their first date to a restaurant in their college town. They began talking
                    more and eventually started dating.

                    Three months go by and they are going on their first trip together! They went to
                    Florida (part 1) with Logan and his family. They visited Disney, saw manatees
                    (his mother LOVES manatees and instilled a love of them in Rachel as well), and
                    enjoyed time on the beach.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    About a month later they went on their second trip together (Florida part 2!)!
                    They went by themselves this time and stayed in a lovely resort, went to
                    Universal (Harry Potter World!), and spent time on the beach.

                    <br />
                    They have since been on wonderful family vacations with Rachel's family to
                    Maryland and Florida.

                    Logan and Rachel began living together in Rachel's last year of school and
                    adopted an adorable Cavapoo puppy that they named Kipper. He became the light of
                    their lives and continues to be today.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    On December 25, 2024, Logan asked Rachel to marry him. She said yes.
